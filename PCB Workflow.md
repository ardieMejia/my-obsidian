The first step is to draw a schematic.  A schematic is simply the symbols and the lines, without the physical details like trace width,  angles and such.  

The second step is the beginning of the actual drawing. This starts with assigning footprints to each component. We determine the exact component, so then we know the dimensions and number of pins. 

The third step is the PCB layout.  Which means choosing the shape and size of border. Some features and tools like layers might help a lot. 

The fourth step is just exporting the Gerber files.  Make sure to export each Gerber for each layers, the BOM, and the dril file for the PCB holes

There are several [[common PCB noob mistakes]] when creating your first one. But we don't need to know it all.  Our focus should instead be on comparisons on cost and alternatives.
