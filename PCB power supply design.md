PCB power supply design considerations:
1. Keep power and ground planes within your board
2. These should symmetrical/centred to avoid bowing
3. Use common rails for each supply
4. avoid creating daisy chains to connect components
5. try to keep traces short and direct.  If you have horizontal trace routing on 1 side, keep vertical on the other side
6. Avoid parallel track to avoid crosstalk
7. Leave spaces around components that may get hot
8. Use thermal conductive planes to average out  heat
9. If its still hot, cooling fans and heat sinks
