PCB design and layout considerations:
1. Decide whether the components can work within a double-sided layer or more is required
2. High speed PCBs typical in servers, rely on high layer counts
3. Some providers use low-end equipment to cut costs
4. PCB is rarely designed perfect from the start
5. PCB is an art, hence some products dont take advantage of Silkscreen. Bad idea
