Jackpot!! sites:
- [random nerd tutorials for esp8266](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/projects-esp8266/) (so many good ones on ESP8226 and other boards) (board names after the  slash)


Intro projects:
- [Connect ESP8226 NodeMCU to IoT cloud](https://www.instructables.com/Getting-Started-With-ESP8266-and-AskSensors-IoT-Pl/) (Very very simple, using AskSensors you can view data read from home on any device with WiFi) (2 dollars, no sensors, just dummy data)
- [Control lights with your voice](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Arduino-Wi-Fi-Shield-Using-ESP8266-for-Voice-C/) (tutorial merely mentions connecting pin 10 to a DC relay, which means more homework, and tutorial is still very helpful) (the board itself + fabricating Arduino UNO WiFi shield + 16by2 panel) (2 + ?? + 5 dollars)
- If we are going the ESP8226 route, [here](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/getting-started-with-esp8266-module) is a very useful introduction (it states how AT commands are common with factory settings)


Purely sensing:
- [Sparkfun Lilypad temperature sensor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lilypad-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide) (cool, wearable project, even the development board can be stitched to clothing) (5 + 27 + 5 + 3 dollars) 
- [Sending sensor data via Bluetooth](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sending-sensor-data-via-bluetooth) (uses 2 ESP32 WROOM, a Bluetooth/Wifi focused board, also Qwiik which is Sparkfun's no-soldering connecting system, project also uses Sparkfun's accelerometer) (10 + 2x24 + 1 + 15 dollars) (parts are merely suggestions, the USB cable for 9 dollars, we can buy ourselves super cheap)
- [Humidity and Temperature Sensor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/si7021-humidity-and-temperature-sensor-hookup-guide) (Maybe not fun coz it uses a  breadboard, but it has the slightly cheaper, cool, simple Sparkfun Redboard, its Arduino R3 sheild compatible, programmed through Arduino IDE) (1 + 5 + 2 + 21 + 17 dollars)


Image manipulation:
- [OpenCV project for RPI minimum](https://raspberrytips.com/install-opencv-on-raspberry-pi/) (very basic boring project) (Pi + keyboard + monitor) (35 + 25 + 45 + dollars)
