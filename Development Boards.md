A development board is simply a system that helps learning a new microprocessor. That is the original goal. That is they used as test board for new released processor. Currently, it is often used by hobbyists. 

There are far too many different development boards available, such as:
1. Arduino
2. Raspberry Pi
3. BeagleBone
4. Intel’s Galileo
5. Texas Instrument’s TI LaunchPad

Some categories of them are:
1. microcontroller boards
	- Arduino Uno  and Mega
	- Adafruit  made
	- SparkFun made
2. single board computers
	- RPi
	- BeagleBone Black
3. powerful,  versatile field-programmable gate array (FPGA) boards

Most likely buying any which of these is fine. But a good idea is to look into some [[development board considerations]]

There are far too many projects, but here is my personal [[development board project categories & sites]]
