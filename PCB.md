 ** [What is a PCB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsdJgEinb34). More important than what is what we can do with it. An example of a tutorial hints that we can use a [[PCB design software]] such as. [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/), and use services like PCBWay or JLCPCB. According to many JLCPCB is better.  PadPCB might be better suited becoz it's based in China. All of these are great for small sized orders. [[PCB manufacture]] is so simple, it almost sounds hacky.

There are [[PCB design and layout]] considerations. There are also [[PCB power supply design]] considerations.

But instead of designing PCBs even as an exercise, which itself  while a learning opportunity, is also an expensive journey. Learning from [[development boards]] probably make more sense.
